        <h1>Labor Force Participation Rate by Disability Status and Age, 2023</h1>
        <p>This bar chart illustrates the labor force participation rates of individuals with and without disabilities,
          segmented by age group. The x-axis represents age ranges (16-19, 20-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55-64), while the
          y-axis represents labor force participation rates as a percentage. Each age group contains two bars: one for
          people with disabilities and one for people without disabilities.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Young Workers (16-19, 20-24):
            <ul>
              <li>Participation is lowest in the 16-19 age group, with both disabled and non-disabled individuals having
                the lowest workforce engagement.</li>
              <li>The rate increases in the 20-24 age range, though a significant gap remains between the two groups.</li>

          </li>
          <li>Prime Working Years (25-34, 35-44, 45-54):
            <ul>

              <li>Non-disabled individuals have high participation rates across these years, peaking between 35-44.</li>
  
              <li>Disabled individuals also experience their highest participation in this range but at substantially
                lower rates than their non-disabled counterparts.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Older Workers (55-64):
            <ul>
              <img src="https://weber.instructure.com/courses/596832/files/117344485/preview" alt="">
              <li>Participation rates decline for both groups as they near retirement age.</li>
              <li>The gap between disabled and non-disabled workers remains evident, though both groups show a downward
                trend.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
  
        <p>This chart highlights the persistent labor force participation gap between disabled and non-disabled
          individuals across all age groups. Younger and older disabled individuals have particularly low participation
          rates, while the disparity is most pronounced in prime working years (25-54).</p>
