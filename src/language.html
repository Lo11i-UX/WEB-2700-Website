                <h2 class="text-white border-bottom pb-2 h2 fw-bold">Plain Language: What is it? And how do I do it?
                </h2>
                <p>Plain language means writing in a way that your audience can easily understand. It focuses on
                    clarity,
                    simplicity, and structure. Whether it's a webpage, email, or document, plain language helps your
                    message
                    come through clearly, especially for people who may be unfamiliar with technical terms or who use
                    screen
                    readers or translation tools.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="primaryColor p-3 rounded mt-4">
                <h3 class="text-white border-bottom pb-2 h3 fw-bold">What Are the Key Guidelines?</h3>
                <h4>Know your audience:</h4>
                <p>Tailor your message to your readers’ needs, expectations, and
                    background. Your audience wants to grasp the message quickly</p>

                <h4>Organize your content:</h4>
                <p>Start with the most important points. Use headings and subheadings. Use bullet points and numbered
                    lists.
                    Reduces the reader's cognitive load.</p>

                <h4>Use Plain and Simple Language:</h4>
                <p>Avoid technical jargon, complex words, and convoluted sentences. Keep your message clear and
                    accessible.
                </p>

                <h4>Use active voice:</h4>
                <p>Active voice makes your writing direct and energetic. While passive voice may appear occasionally,
                    active
                    voice is preferred.</p>

                <h4>Stay consistent:</h4>
                <p>Consistency in style and terminology enhances clarity. Use uniform language throughout your document.
                </p>

                <h4 class="border-top pt-3">Summary</h4>
                <p>Plain language guidelines are essential tools for clear communication. They help you
                    produce transparent and effective content. Although sticking to these principles is ideal,
                    slight deviations may occur as you balance clarity with the nuances of language.

                                        The environmental impacts of urbanization have been significant, particularly
                                        concerning the increase
                                        in air pollution levels and the reduction in green spaces due to the expansion
                                        of
                                        infrastructure. Cities
                                        have been experiencing a rise in air pollutants resulting from increased
                                        vehicular
                                        emissions and industrial
                                        activities. This has been exacerbated by the reduction in natural environments,
                                        which has decreased the
                                        capacity for city landscapes to filter out pollution naturally. Noise pollution
                                        has
                                        also become predominant,
                                        with the increasing population density leading to a surge in transportation
                                        noise
                                        and general urban activity.
                                        These environmental challenges have prompted cities to adopt various measures
                                        aimed
                                        at mitigating their
                                        impacts, such as the implementation of green roofs and the creation of urban
                                        parks.
                                        Moreover, public
                                        transportation systems have been expanded and improved to reduce reliance on
                                        personal vehicles. Efforts to
                                        promote sustainable practices are continuing, as are initiatives to enhance
                                        urban

                                        Urbanization has increased air and noise pollution while reducing green spaces.
                                        Rising vehicle use and
                                        industrial activity contribute to poor air quality, and fewer natural areas mean

                                        public transportation to

                                <h3>What is Active Voice?</h3>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Definition:</strong> In an active sentence, the subject performs the
                                        action.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Example:</strong> "The cat chased the mouse." (Here, "the cat" is doing
                                        the chasing.)</li>

                                <h3>What is Passive Voice?</h3>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Definition:</strong> Passive sentences often use forms of "to be" plus a
                                        past participle.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Example:</strong> "The mouse was chased by the cat." (Here, "the mouse"
                                        receives the action.)</li>
                                </ul>

                                <h3>How to Switch from Passive to Active:</h3>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Identify the subject (the doer).<br><em>Passive:</em>
                                        "The mouse was chased by the cat."</li>
                                    <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Move the doer to the beginning.<br><em>Active:</em>
                                        "The cat chased the mouse."</li>
                                    <li><strong>Tip:</strong> If the doer is missing, add it.<br><em>Passive:</em> "The
                                        report was completed."<br><em>Active:</em> "The team completed the report."</li>
                                </ul>

                                <h3>Why Use Active Voice?</h3>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Clearer and more direct senten~ces</li>
                                    <li>More engaging and powerful writing</li>
                                    <li>Better for instructions, persuasion, and clear communication</li>
