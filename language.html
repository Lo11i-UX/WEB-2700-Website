            <p>The environmental impacts of urbanization have been significant, particularly
                concerning the increase in air pollution levels and the reduction in green spaces due to
                the expansion of infrastructure. Cities have been experiencing a rise in air pollutants
                resulting from increased vehicular emissions and industrial activities. This has been
                exacerbated by the reduction in natural environments, which has decreased the
                capacity for city landscapes to filter out pollution naturally.</p>
            <p>Noise pollution has also become predominant, with the increasing population
                density leading to a surge in transportation noise and general urban activity. These
                environmental challenges have prompted cities to adopt various measures aimed at
                mitigating their impacts, such as the implementation of green roofs and the creation of
                urban parks.</p>
            <p>Moreover, public transportation systems have been expanded and improved to
                reduce reliance on personal vehicles. Efforts to promote sustainable practices are
                continuing, as are initiatives to enhance urban resilience in the face of environmental
                challenges.</p>

            <p>Plain language guidelines are essential tools for clear communication. They help you
                produce transparent and effective content. Although sticking to these principles is ideal,
                slight deviations may occur as you balance clarity with the nuances of language.</p>

        <article aria-labelledby="Active-vs-Passive-Voice">
            <h2 id="Active-vs-Passive-Voice">Active vs. Passive Voice</h2>
            <h3>What is Active Voice?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Definition: In an active sentence, the subject performs the action.</li>
                <li>Example: "The cat chased the mouse." (Here, "the cat" is doing the chasing.)</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>What is Passive Voice?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Definition: Passive sentences often use forms of "to be" (am, is, are, was, were) plus a past
                    participle.</li>
                <li>Example: "The mouse was chased by the cat." (Here, "the mouse" receives the action.)</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>How to Switch from Passive to Active:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Step 1: Identify the subject (the doer).</li>
                Passive: "The mouse was chased by the cat."
                <li>Move the doer to the beginning of the sentence.</li>
                Active: "The cat chased the mouse."
                <li>Tip: If the doer is missing, add it.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Why Use Active Voice?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Benefits:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Clearer and more direct sentences</li>
                        <li>More engaging and powerful writing</li>
                        <li>Better for instructions, persuasion, and clear communication</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Understanding Verb Tenses and Forms</h2>
            <h3>Simple Verb Forms (Preferred for Clarity)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Simple Present:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Example: "walk"</li>
                        <li>Usage: Habits and general truths (e.g., "She walks to school every day.")</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Simple Past:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Example: "walked"</li>
                        <li>Usage: Actions that happened in the past (e.g., "She walked to school yesterday.")</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Simple Future:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Example: "will walk"</li>
                        <li>Usage: Actions that will occur (e.g., "She will walk to school tomorrow.")</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Continuous Verb Forms</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Definition: These forms show ongoing action.</li>
                <li>Examples:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Present continuous: "is walking"</li>
                        <li>Past continuous: "was walking"</li>
                        <li>Future continuous: "will be walking"</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Note: They can add complexity without adding clarity.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <h3>Perfect Verb Forms</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Definition: These forms relate actions to another time.</li>
                <li>Examples:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Present perfect: "has walked"</li>
                        <li>Past perfect: "had walked"</li>
                        <li>Future perfect: "will have walked"</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Note: They often make sentences harder to understand when simple forms would do.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <h3>Perfect Continuous Forms</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Definition: These combine perfect and continuous aspects (e.g., "has been walking").</li>
                <li>Note: They often make sentences harder to understand when simple forms would do.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>

            <h3>Recommendation for Clear Writing:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Use Simple Forms: They keep sentences direct and easy to read.</li>
                <li>Reserve Complex Forms: Use them only when you need to express detailed time frames or continuous
                    actions.</li>
