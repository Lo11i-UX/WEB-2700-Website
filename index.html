            <p>The 2021 American Community Survey by the Census Bureau reported 13% of all Americans
                have a non-institutionalized disability. Of the roughly 38,903,887 adults with a disability in the
                United States, 19.7% of them live below the poverty line. This is almost double the number of
                adults in the United States who are below the poverty line. This is partially due to lower rates of
                employment for disabled people. In the United States, 25.9% of disabled people over the age of
                16 are employed in the civilian sector, while 59.6% of all US citizens over 16 are employed in
                the same sector.</p>
            <p>Comparing the breakdown of disability between my current state of residence, Utah, and the
                United States, Utah has a disabled population of 342,378 or 10.3% of the total population,
                compared to the United States which has 42,485,034 disabled people or 13.0% of the total
                population. Table 1: Disability Type by Gender for Utah and the United States shows the
                disparities between genders and types of disabilities.</p>

                <p>There are a few reasons why these disparities exist; however, that is not a topic for this page.</p>
            <p>When it comes to representation by race, there are some interesting differences between Utah
                and the United States. Table 2: Disability Percent by Race, you can see that Utah has a higher
                occurrence of disabilities in the Black or African American, American Indian and Alaska Natives,
                Native Hawaiâ€™ian and Other Pacific Islanders, and the Hispanic or Latino communities than the
                United States as a whole. However, for the White community in Utah, they have a lower
                occurrence of disability than the national rate.</p>
            <p>When we take into consideration the rates of disabilities in the United States (roughly 40
                million people) and Utah (roughly 350,000 people), we can understand the importance of
                building accessible experiences for all people.</p>

            <h1>Labor Force Participation Rate by Disability Status and Age, 2023</h1>
            <p>This bar chart illustrates the labor force participation rates of individuals with and without disabilities, segmented by age group. The x-axis represents age ranges (16-19, 20-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55-64), while the y-axis represents labor force participation rates as a percentage. Each age group contains two bars: one for people with disabilities and one for people without disabilities.</p>

                <li>Tolerance for Error</li>
                The design minimizes hazards and the adverse consequences of accidental or
                unintended actions

                <li>Low Physical Effort</li>
                The design can be used efficiently and comfortably and with a minimum of fatigue

                <li>Size and Space for Approach and Use</li>
                Appropriate size and space is provided for approach, reach, manipulation, and use
                regardless of userâ€™s body size, posture, or mobility
