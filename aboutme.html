        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            My name is Lauren Barfuss, I am in web dsign/devolepment because, I am studying web and user experience
            design and want to specialize in web accessiblity.
            Some of my hobbies are being outdoors, I recently picked up a new hobby in skiing and I love to cook and
            bake. I also like performing in musical theatre as well as any other musical thing as well.
            My favorite colors are black and red.

        <h2>When I Hear “Accessibility”</h2>
        <p>
            When I hear accessiblity I hear making places, sites, and products user friendly for every user in the world
            to the best we can. I personally find accessiblity interesting to learn because, I've been learning a lot
            more of it at my job and here in this class. I think that accessbility is very essential for all people, we
            need to make sure our design is inclusive for all users. We should give them the best experience using our
            sites otherwise the sites may be redundant and frustrating for our users if we don't think about their
            needs.
        </p>

        <h2>Automated Tools are NOT Enough</h2>
        <p>
            Automated accessibility tools like WAVE are great for catching quick issues. Wave can also help us fix the
            fast errors but, doesn't go into the deeper errors. However, it can help us with correcting color contrast.
        </p>

        <h3>Accessibility Standards I Use</h3>
        <p>
            The web standards I know are the WCAG standards for web compliance have been devolped by the W3C to help us
            use these guidelines to make sites user friendly for all users. The 508 act requires us to be accomadating
            for those with disabilities. With the WCAG guidelines there's a minimum of requirements that must be met such as level standards. 
        </p>

        <h3>Why Inclusion During Design/Development Matters</h3>
        <p>
            Including people of all backgrounds and abilities in testing and design means the product will work for
            everyone especially for users with disabilities. When sites aren't user friendly it can frustrate users
            especially if they don't have visual or physical aids to help.
